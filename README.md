# Sholdice's repo for random Javascript stuff and game prep.

This is primarily for collecting a bunch of javascript things and letting me access it from multiple places. Also a basic store for the pre-alpha of my planned game "Adway."

## Random_Game_JS.js

A collection of small snippets that I use in many other situations that I'd like to get access to regularly. Not super useful on it's own but it exists.

## Adway_Alpha

Pre-alpha development for my game "Adway". May end up using this for a beta or staging area if this ends up going live at some point.
