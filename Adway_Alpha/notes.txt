Adway roadmap

Basic world design and implementation
-World maps/zones
-Dungeons/maps/whatever
-Exploring concept

Exploring is through combat, clean up afterwards with some kind of
investigation thing, each cell fully scouted out is bonus resource
generation and maybe discover some cool things. Maybe some forward
scouting added also to see what's coming up.

Figure out combat pieces:
Combat Timer:
-base turn time is 1s, haste makes it tick down faster
-some abilities could in theory have different turn times
-adds interaction with this sort of mechanic potentially

Combat
-Simple turn ordering and fighting
-TODO: AI, more complicated combat

Game Save
-Local save to start, online later
-TODO: String compression
-TODO: Online Save

XP Growth
-Gaining xp/levelling up
-Increasing max level

Offline progress
-Probably just store the time and let it run fast to catch up
--Time afk stored. Either background tab or offline will all store it I think.
--Game loop will run faster if able.
--TODO: Actual acceleration if needed

--Decision: for now rework things to be single attacker and cut back on classes
---I'll come back to this later I think but for now it's just too much and will get in the way of things.
---Focus on basic combat and extra systems. Initial characters in story will intro other pieces of the game.

Party wipe
-Just turn off combat until regen brings them back to full.
-Add in some bonuses to out of combat regen of various resources

Between Combat time
-Maybe a half second after something dies before spawning something new in.
--Change party wipe to non-combat?
--Feels weird without a break, needs testing

Proper setup of saving/loading

Basic world design and implementation
-World maps/zones
--Enemy spawns, limitations, different enemies
-Story
--Zones are going to be a lot bigger I think. Have them tied directly to story.

Fixed serialization of systems

// Changed Level to individual stats
    Change XP giving a level to XP going specifically into different stats.
    Crit, Haste, attack, health, others to come.
        Maybe stuff like dodge, block, multistrike, parry, crit damage, etc
        Easy to add new things too when 'people teach you new techniques'
        Could even add xp gain 
    Prestige is learning new techniques, unlearning old 'bad habits'
    Need to worry about the problems with things scaling very high
        Eg. haste gets weird and I don't want it to be too high
        Crit will probably get over 100% chance and I can do crit tiers
        Might do something with rating conversions like wow but for zones
// Need to monitor cost/benefit curves and xp generation curves

I am here ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Story
-Need to do the tutorial and early bits of story
--See Story.txt

Resets
-Reset currency
    Some kind of memory drug stuff.
    Need a name for it.
-Reset process
    You wont change but the world wont be quite as you think you remember it

Scraps:
    Scraps are something you pick up and get along the way, similar to xp.
    On your first trip back to town it'll unlock basic equipment.
    Eventually "you know we could sell these right?"
        A place to earn gold and starting to set up a larger economy

    Equipment
        Persistent gear that you keep between Resets
        slowly grow it with some options for builds
        Junk existing equipment for more Scraps
            as a re-roll or to crunch old stuff for bigger stuff
        
    Equipment information:
        All equipment will come with 1 primary stat(maybe more eventually), 0 or more secondaries, and 0 meta stats
        Item level and quality will dictate stat budget. Primary stat is fixed, secondaries will vary.
            Enchanting will come later, enchanting will add value to gear
                Add to secondary stat budget, increase item level (sort of the same)

Dungeons/Raids:
Special places that should always have some pretty good persistent rewards
    They should move around between runs, not too much but just enough to be cool
    Lots of lore, for them too to make good story points
    They'll slowly refill over time like in clickocalypse
    Extra good rewards that make the reset nice
        Should encourage, but not require reset periods based on them?
        Maybe set them up to be a daily-like system?
            Dailies/weeklies like mmo loot lockouts
    Important information:
        Where they are found
        Their own zone type structure
            How many floors, bosses, traps? etc.
        Drops
            From the boss, what kinds of items, what rarities, etc.
        Other rewards
            XP, maybe some raw scraps. Other things later on.
    
Arena:
Place in town you can pay to participate in arena matches
    Grind out some XP
    Can choose how difficult it is, better rewards for harder contests
    Costs gold to enter

Upgrades
    Stat tier upgrades exist. Unlock conditions/requirements unknown
        Scaling will be adjusted for tuning.
    Thoughts are leaving them persistent after being unlocked
        Limiting factor would be xp gain, probably not best.
            Too strong for going back for early things.
        Could also add in a zone milestone even in each run. to combat.
    


VISUALS-----------------------------------------------

Some basic UI work
-Do a small mockup
-Start thinking about art and theme options
-Is it possible to massively change ui for a "work mode" or something?
--It is, do I want to do it?

Animation Engine?
-Need to figure out how I want to architect it
-Big giant thing or make it small for each one?
-Not even ready to think about spell animations

--Real GUID system?

--Dodge spaghet code problems when you update combat and event/aura owners


------------------------------Version 1.0 end, Launch around here--------------

------------------Version 1.1 update plans-------------------------------------

New story obviously
-Will figure out launch story before getting there

Classes
-Wanderer base, Warrior/Mage + something techy (chemist? tinker? rogue/thief/archer?)
--Class progression structure and improved combat for abilities


Expansion/Major patch ideas -----------------------------

Most feature unlocks will be either you find a new way to get stronger
personally or you find someone that helps you make town better.

A RG/CC/CH/IW style 'buy buildings get income" etc side game
-Need a theme/flavor for it
--That should dictate a huge amount of the rest of it.

Exploration
-Exploration, dungeons, etc
--Thinking something like etrian odyysey mapping out dungeons
--Would have to be largely active and some good rewards for finishing floor
--Would need to do something to avoid "look up the right map"

-Tattoos
--Tattoos often have some cool power associated with them, could be neat
--Kidn of like rune words but could turn it into tattoos easily

-"The swarm" (critter mound style thing maybe)
--No clue how to make this make any sense, fights enemy swarm maybe?

-Alchemy/potions
--Consumables, generic abilities anyone can use with potion theme

-"The Box" reverse containment chamber from antimemetics
--This is where challenges might come in, left notes for self (remember more) makes it harder
--Could have some fun with the name things for 'a day without X' for challenges
---E.G. Sleep challenge (A day without sleep), Hope (A day without hope), etc

-Museum/Artifacts?
--Some kind of collection system, complete sets for bonuses
--You learn something from studying a whole set to get some benefit

-Reputations/Factions
--Unsure if I want to make these persistent or per-run.
--Per run could introduce more 'builds' and make some more interesting choices
--Persistent would just be a nice longer progression system
---Leaning to per-run with some milestone rewards.
---Need to figure out how to encourage trying new ones and so on.

-"Walk the path to power"
--some corrupted power structure
--cosmic elements maybe

-Summons
--Kind of like spells from other games like RG or Idle Wizard
--Big cooldown but some major payoff for it? Requires active to start
--Potential for extra tie ins and additional progression
---Summons are cool right?

-Beastiary
--Some way to learn about the enemies with some reward for it.

// TODO collection:
-Game saving
--Online saving: for later
--Save string compression
-Crowdsource enemies
-More complicated combat, not just attacks
-Changelog for post launch
