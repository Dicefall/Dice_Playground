Adway roadmap

Basic world design and implementation
-World maps/zones
-Dungeons/maps/whatever

Figure out combat pieces:
Combat Timer:
-base turn time is 1s, haste makes it tick down faster
-some abilities could in theory have different turn times
-adds interaction with this sort of mechanic potentially

Combat
-Simple turn ordering and fighting
-TODO: AI, more complicated combat

Game Save
-Local save to start, online later
-TODO: String compression
-TODO: Online Save

XP Growth
-Gaining xp/levelling up
-Increasing max level

Offline progress
-Probably just store the time and let it run fast to catch up
--Time afk stored. Either background tab or offline will all store it I think.
--Game loop will run faster if able.
--TODO: Actual acceleration if needed

--Decision: for now rework things to be single attacker and cut back on classes
---I'll come back to this later I think but for now it's just too much and will get in the way of things.
---Focus on basic combat and extra systems. Initial characters in story will intro other pieces of the game.

Party wipe
-Just turn off combat until regen brings them back to full.
-Add in some bonuses to out of combat regen of various resources

Between Combat time
-Maybe a half second after something dies before spawning something new in.
--Change party wipe to non-combat?
--Feels weird without a break, needs testing

Proper setup of saving/loading

Basic world design and implementation
-World maps/zones
--Enemy spawns, limitations, different enemies
-Story
--Zones are going to be a lot bigger I think. Have them tied directly to story.

Fixed serialization of systems

// Changed Level to individual stats
    Change XP giving a level to XP going specifically into different stats.
    Crit, Haste, attack, health, others to come.
        Maybe stuff like dodge, block, multistrike, parry, crit damage, etc
        Easy to add new things too when 'people teach you new techniques'
        Could even add xp gain 
    Prestige is learning new techniques, unlearning old 'bad habits'
    Need to worry about the problems with things scaling very high
        Decided to go with secondary stat ratings and rating to % conversions
// Need to monitor cost/benefit curves and xp generation curves

Upgrades: 
    Stat tier upgrades exist. Unlock conditions/requirements unknown
        Scaling will be adjusted for tuning.
    Thoughts are leaving them persistent after being unlocked
        Limiting factor would be xp gain, probably not best.
            Too strong for going back for early things.
        Could also add in a zone milestone even in each run. to combat.
    TODO: UI stuff and connect it to clickables and double check everything from there.

Arena:
Place in town you can pay to participate in arena matches
    Grind out some XP
    Can choose how difficult it is, better rewards for harder contests
    Costs gold to enter (One free tournament unlocked right away)
    They are lose-able.
        Losing cashes out and makes you start over.
    Reward breakpoint is probably a couple places in.
        Need to hammer out balance of this a bit more strictly
    Special arenas might pop up with unique characters or unlocks

    Different tournament styles
        Options for type, size, difficulty/payout, other specials later,
            Types:
            Double knockout (losers bracket basically)
            Single Elim
            round robin (can lead into another type)
            'dungeon run' (up to X losses, fight people of same win count)
                This is essentially an N knockout type instead of single/double elim
    
    Rewards
        Based on your ranking in the arena.


I am here ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Story
-Need to do the tutorial and early bits of story
--See Story.txt
    Story up to reset area planned...ish

Reset perks:
Currency named Essence, funnel it into attributes to boost core aspects of the person
    Strength, dex, con, etc. Traditional main character stats from old school rpgs.
Implementation
    Just need to decide what each one actually does, how many to include at the start, and connect it all up
    

            
---------------------
TODO before pre-alpha
Content/story up to reset (z15?)
    Zone contents
        Zone names/concepts up to z15 done.
    Story text
Upgrades
    Stat tier upgrade unlocks back end. Names and effects done.
Attributes
    Purchasing/planning
    Kind of a UI/Front end block

UI
    Drawn out plan, just need to figure out how to do it
Testing plan
    Basic guide on simple goals and how to start
    What sort of feedback I am interested and directed goals of testing

-Semi-done
Basic balancing
    Set proper rating scaling, set for slightly harsher than tier ups
Game speedup
    Add ui update for large speedups
Reset perks
    Add a few more and balance income
Arenas
    Need arena clear rewards

Code Cleanup
    Move a bunch of the utils things into class stuff.

TODO:
    Timer/Event owners as abstract ref

VISUALS-----------------------------------------------

Some basic UI work
-Do a small mockup
-Start thinking about art and theme options
-Is it possible to massively change ui for a "work mode" or something?
--It is, do I want to do it?


------------------------------Version 1.0 end, Launch around here--------------

------------------Version 1.1-2 update plans-----------------------------------

Patch notes prep

New story obviously
-Will figure out launch story before getting there

Classes
-Wanderer base, Warrior/Mage + something techy (tinker? rogue/thief/archer?)
--Class progression structure and improved combat for abilities
    Think bravely default style classes, fluffy(trimps) style progression maybe

-Alchemy/potions
--Consumables, generic abilities anyone can use with potion theme

-Food buffs
--Pick from a selection of food at the start of the run, different buffs.
--Somehow learn new recepies to make new foods that have a larger selection
    and maybe some straight up better buffs

-Reputations/Factions
--Choose a faction to align with each run, get bonuses for each faction.
--As you progress during the run your reptuation will increase
    Increase reputation for more milestones to get cool benefits
    Not 100% sure on how to increase reptuations just yet.

Expansion/Major patch ideas -----------------------------

Most feature unlocks will be either you find a new way to get stronger
personally or you find someone that helps you make town better.

Dungeons/Raids/Equipment
    Wanted to put it in earlier but need to figure more specifics later.
    Basic idea is heirlooms mixed with wow equipment.

A RG/CC/CH/IW style 'buy buildings get income" etc side game
-Need a theme/flavor for it
--That should dictate a huge amount of the rest of it.

Exploration
-Exploration, dungeons, etc
--Thinking something like etrian odyysey mapping out dungeons
--Would have to be largely active and some good rewards for finishing floor
--Would need to do something to avoid "look up the right map"

-Tattoos
--Tattoos often have some cool power associated with them, could be neat
--Kidn of like rune words but could turn it into tattoos easily

-"The swarm" (critter mound style thing maybe)
--No clue how to make this make any sense, fights enemy swarm maybe?

-"The Box" reverse containment chamber from antimemetics
--This is where challenges might come in, left notes for self (remember more) makes it harder
--Could have some fun with the name things for 'a day without X' for challenges
---E.G. Sleep challenge (A day without sleep), Hope (A day without hope), etc

-Museum/Artifacts?
--Some kind of collection system, complete sets for bonuses
--You learn something from studying a whole set to get some benefit

-"Walk the path to power"
--some corrupted power structure
--cosmic elements maybe

-Summons
--Kind of like spells from other games like RG or Idle Wizard
--Big cooldown but some major payoff for it? Requires active to start
--Potential for extra tie ins and additional progression
---Summons are cool right?

-Beastiary
--Some way to learn about the enemies with some reward for it.

Upgrade visuals ------

Animation Engine?
-Need to figure out how I want to architect it
-Big giant thing or make it small for each one?
-Not even ready to think about spell animations

// TODO collection:
-Game saving
--Online saving: for later
--Save string compression
-Crowdsource enemies
-More complicated combat, not just attacks
-Changelog for post launch

Spoiler free tl;dr of new mechanics

Classes/Jobs (like final fantasy type stuff)
Alchemy and potions and flasks and stuff
Food buffs, legit straight out of wow, cooking and buffs
Reputations/factions, again mostly an mmo idea not 100% sure what I want to do yet
Some kind of exploration thing, like sending people back to look through cleared stuff or scouting new areas
Some kind of tattoo system where you can get tattoos for certain buffs
The swarm, some kind of army you build and get to breed things and control traits and stuff, like critter mound or something
Some kind of town where all of this is housed and controlled from but also building up some big support systems, maybe toss in an old school incremental like CH or RG or CC or something.
Summons, initially something like RG spells maybe, maybe just big extra combat power somehow idk
Bestiary, long term collection and completion % rewards
Sidequests, basically just achievements.
