Adway roadmap

Basic world design and implementation
-World maps/zones
-Dungeons/maps/whatever
-Exploring concept

Exploring is through combat, clean up afterwards with some kind of
investigation thing, each cell fully scouted out is bonus resource
generation and maybe discover some cool things. Maybe some forward
scouting added also to see what's coming up.

Figure out combat pieces:
Combat Timer:
-base turn time is 1s, haste makes it tick down faster
-some abilities could in theory have different turn times
-adds interaction with this sort of mechanic potentially

-TODO: mess with actual turn timer, balance issue

Combat
-Simple turn ordering and fighting
-TODO: AI, more complicated combat

Growth
-Gaining xp/levelling up
-Increasing max level

Game Save
-Local save to start, online later

Buffs/Debuffs
-Based on real world time
-Central object to manage or part of character it's attached to

Jobs/Classes
-Different attacks maybe, or procs
-Class mastery effects or special passives for each one
-Stat modifiers for the classes
