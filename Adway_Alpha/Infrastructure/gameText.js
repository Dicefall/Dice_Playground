            "You find yourself alone in a field surrounded by the aftermath of a battle. You remember none of it. There are a few green skinned monsters walking around cleaning up what's left of the fighting. One spots you.",
            "Finally, you spot someone who isn't trying to kill you. She walks over and introduces herself as Meryl. 'Where are the others? The last time I...Of course you don't remember. You probably don't even remember me.' She sighs loudly. 'Alright, lets get moving. You wont believe me unless you see it, you never do.' She turns around and motions for you to follow her.",
            "Meryl doesn't look all there, you know, in the head. She's constantly looking off into space focusing on something very far away. She's caught you staring a few times but it doesn't seem like that's anything new for her.",
            "In the brief moments between fighting one greenskin and the next, Meryl tells you where she's leading you. 'First place to go is back to Forest Glen, to get prepared for the climb. After that it's climbing Mount <<<fancy mountain name>>>. It'll all be clear then.' You don't know why but you believe her. If nothing else it feels like she's on your team. She hasn't tried to kill you yet so what have you got to lose.",
            "Was that a dragon?! A dragon?! This shouldn't surprise you, but it does. You just fought a dragon. I wonder if there will be more of them",
            // Zone change over
            "You find a secluded thicket to hide in for the night. Meryl found it for you, or led you to it. She seemed to know where she was going but was also surprised when she stumbled upon it. She's a weird one.",
            "Before going to sleep Meryl tells you a bit more about what's going on. 'I don't want you to be startled when we get to Forest Glen. People will know you, but you wont know them. You've just forgotten. It happens every time and it's no need to be startled. Maybe the others will have gotten there and we can get back to the plan, which of course you also can't remember.' She rolls her eyes and sighs again. She does that a lot.",
            "It was a good night's sleep. You're ready to keep going. Meryl is surprised when she sees you in the morning and looks around as if then expecting more people. 'Just you?' You nod and shrug back. 'You never were much of a talker.' You're not sure how to respond to that, so you just finish packing up and start the trip to Forest Glen",
            "Meryl remains quiet the rest of the trip. You don't mind so much though since you're mostly busy trying to stay alive.",
            "Wait, that's neither a forest nor a glen. You ask Meryl why it's called Forest Glen when it's clearly neither of those things. 'It was once. We've done this so many times now, it's outgrown it's name. No reason to change it though, has a nice ring to it.",
