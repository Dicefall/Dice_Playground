Adway roadmap

Basic world design and implementation
-World maps/zones
-Dungeons/maps/whatever
-Exploring concept

Exploring is through combat, clean up afterwards with some kind of
investigation thing, each cell fully scouted out is bonus resource
generation and maybe discover some cool things. Maybe some forward
scouting added also to see what's coming up.

Figure out combat pieces:
Combat Timer:
-base turn time is 1s, haste makes it tick down faster
-some abilities could in theory have different turn times
-adds interaction with this sort of mechanic potentially

Combat
-Simple turn ordering and fighting
-TODO: AI, more complicated combat

Game Save
-Local save to start, online later
-TODO: String compression
-TODO: Online Save

XP Growth
-Gaining xp/levelling up
-Increasing max level

Offline progress
-Probably just store the time and let it run fast to catch up
--Time afk stored. Either background tab or offline will all store it I think.
--Game loop will run faster if able.
--TODO: Actual acceleration if needed

--Decision: for now rework things to be single attacker and cut back on classes
---I'll come back to this later I think but for now it's just too much and will get in the way of things.
---Focus on basic combat and extra systems. Initial characters in story will intro other pieces of the game.

Party wipe
-Just turn off combat until regen brings them back to full.
-Add in some bonuses to out of combat regen of various resources

Between Combat time
-Maybe a half second after something dies before spawning something new in.
--Change party wipe to non-combat?
--Feels weird without a break, needs testing

Proper setup of saving/loading

I am here ---------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------Fixed serialization of systems-----------------------------

// Still need some kind of character progress at the run level

Basic world design and implementation
-World maps/zones
--Enemy spawns, limitations, different enemies
-Story
--Zones are going to be a lot bigger I think. Have them tied directly to story.

Story
-Need to do the tutorial and early bits of story
--See Story.txt

Resets
-Reset currency
-Reset process

Scraps
-Something for scraps.
--They do nothing right now
--Create basic equipment system out of this.
--Sort of liking the way idle wizard handles it, might start there


VISUALS-----------------------------------------------

Some basic UI work
-Do a small mockup
-Start thinking about art and theme options
-Is it possible to massively change ui for a "work mode" or something?
--It is, do I want to do it?

Animation Engine?
-Need to figure out how I want to architect it
-Big giant thing or make it small for each one?
-Not even ready to think about spell animations

--Real GUID system?

--Dodge spaghet code problems when you update combat and event/aura owners

----Bugfixes / Feature updates
Update plans-----------------------------------------

Gear (Save for classes/jobs?)
-Equipment from scraps/other resources
-Extra stats?
-Randomness
-Armor types

Other Features!

Need some kind of automation system fantasy idea

Jobs/Classes
-Different attacks maybe, or procs
-Class mastery effects or special passives for each one
-Stat modifiers for the classes

Expansion/Major patch ideas -----------------------------

Exploration
-Exploration, dungeons, etc
--Thinking something like etrian odyysey mapping out dungeons
--Would have to be largely active and some good rewards for finishing floor
--Would need to do something to avoid "look up the right map"

-Enchanting gear
-Long term gear scaling system maybe, researching new stuff
-Actual presistent gear

-"The swarm" (critter mound style thing maybe)
--No clue how to make this make any sense, fights enemy swarm maybe?

-Town of some sort
--Maybe houses a lot of the other mechanisms
--They would know only that you're fighting
--Part of unlocking stuff and new systems like a mage tower etc

-Alchemy/potions
--Consumables, generic abilities anyone can use with potion theme

-Quest system (probably just fancy stuff (ui) thrown on top of events)
--This will be for everything, unlocks, etc
--Should be regularly hooked into event system

-"The Box" reverse containment chamber from antimemetics
--This is where challenges might come in, left notes for self (remember more) makes it harder
--Could have some fun with the name things for 'a day without X' for challenges
---E.G. Sleep challenge (A day without sleep), Hope (A day without hope), etc

-Museum/Artifacts?
--Some kind of collection system, copmlete sets for bonuses

-Reputations
--Factions of some kind with presistent reputations and rewards

-Alignment bonuses
--Pick some kind of approach based on good/evil and law/chaos
--Neat 9x9 grid of potentially interesting bonuses
--Probably tie this into the town or non-direct player power

-"Walk the path to power"
--some corrupted power structure
--cosmic elements maybe

-Summons
--Kind of like spells from other games like RG or Idle Wizard
--Big cooldown but some major payoff for it? Requires active to start
--Potential for extra tie ins and additional progression

Tutorial Steps:
-Intro to world breifly and tell player to pick up scraps
--Pick up a sufficient amount of scrap, maybe just wait some small amount of time watching number go up a bit.
-Run into meryl, little story telling, keep getting scraps and wait breifly
--Very short time wait, just an actual time wait.
--Start combat, next step after combat (first enemy) is over.

--Not ironed out past here
--reverse containment chamber, can start growing this into something larger

// TODO repo:
-Game saving
--Online saving: for later
--Save string compression
-Crowdsource enemies
-More complicated combat, not just attacks
